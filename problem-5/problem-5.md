### Aproach ###
Creates a trie data structure and inserts a list of words into the trie. A trie can be used to store strings. Each node in the trie represents a single character in a string. The children of a node represent the next characters in the string.

### Run time complexity ###
The run time complexity of the trie data structure depends on the number of words that are inserted into the trie. Where m is the number of words in the trie and n is the average length of the words.
=> The average case run time complexity is O(m*n)
