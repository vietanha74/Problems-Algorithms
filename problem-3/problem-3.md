### Aproach ###
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

We need to find the two numbers with the maximum sum. To do this, we can sort the array in descending order.

After sorting the array, we can iterate over the sorted array and form the two numbers by alternating the digits. We can start with the first digit and add it to the first number, then add the next digit to the second number, and so on.

Finally, we return the two numbers as the result.
